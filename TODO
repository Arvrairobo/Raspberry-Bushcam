check if pigpiod is running prior to calling dht stuff -- if not then disable temp/humidity stuff
encode to mp4 from stream instead of a file to cut down on disk writes
handle running out of disk space gracefully (user configurable threshold to stop recording)
set up to use configuration files

write backup script:
	should check once a day
	check for unencoded files and encode them (will be moot once stream encoding is written)
	copy files that donâ€™t match the current date
	verify they made it and delete the old ones
