check if pigpiod is running prior to calling dht stuff -- if not then disable temp/humidity stuff
encode to mp4 from stream instead of a file to cut down on disk writes
add a countdown to the warmup sequence
set up to use configuration files
add all dependencies to README
make output less verbose, maybe add formatting and ability to trigger video from terminal
logging options

write backup script:
	should check once a day
	check for unencoded files and encode them (will be moot once stream encoding is written)
	copy files that donâ€™t match the current date
	verify they made it and delete the old ones

handle running modules as stand-alone and give them useful cli guidance.
